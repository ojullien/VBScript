## Contributing

Thanks you for taking the time to contribute! 
As this project is a personal project, I do not have time to develop new submitted features or feature requests.
But if you encounter any **bugs**, please open an [issue](https://github.com/ojullien/vbscript/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
